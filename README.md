# HomePod TTS — Custom Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration that plays TTS announcements with an optional chime sound on Apple HomePod, using **Google Gemini TTS** or any **Home Assistant TTS engine** (Edge TTS, Google Translate, Piper, etc.) for speech synthesis and **Music Assistant / pyatv** for AirPlay streaming.

## Why?

Home Assistant's built-in `apple_tv` integration uses pyatv for AirPlay streaming, which delegates audio decoding to the `miniaudio` library. `miniaudio` frequently fails with `DecodeError('failed to init decoder', -1)` when streaming TTS audio to HomePod — a long-standing regression ([#71569](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/71569), [#97075](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/97075), [#123176](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/123176)).

This integration **bypasses the bug entirely** by:
1. Generating TTS audio via Google Gemini API
2. Concatenating chime + TTS (+ optional music) with ffmpeg into a local WAV file
3. Streaming the local file via Music Assistant (synchronized AirPlay 2) or pyatv's `stream_file()` as fallback

## Features

- Chime + TTS announcements on HomePod via AirPlay
- **Choice of TTS engine** — Google Gemini TTS, or any `tts.*` engine already configured in Home Assistant (Edge TTS, Google Translate, Piper, etc.)
- **Music injection** — embed a `[music: prompt]` marker in any message to append a generated Lyria 3 music clip (Gemini only)
- **`play_music` service** — generate and play standalone AI music via Gemini Lyria 3
- Google Gemini TTS with selectable model and voice (30 voices)
- For HA TTS engines, dynamic Language/Voice dropdowns populated from whatever the selected engine supports
- Style prompts for controlling speech tone and pacing (Gemini only)
- Dynamic range compression presets (off / light / moderate / heavy)
- Adjustable chime volume relative to TTS in the audio mix
- Speaker override — target any HomePod(s) from a single entity
- **HomePod mini volume scaling** — per-speaker volume compensation for quieter mini speakers via an entity label
- **Quiet mode** — lower volume, whisper prompt, and alternate speakers when a quiet-mode entity is active
- **Mute mode** — completely suppress announcements when a mute entity is active
- **Music Assistant health sensor** — surfaces whether configured speakers resolve in MA or fall back to pyatv
- **Operational entity attributes** — the notify entity exposes effective volume, speakers, mute/quiet state, cache and TTS settings for inspection
- TTS response caching with configurable max size and manual clear
- Volume control with automatic restore after playback
- Music Assistant transport for synchronized multi-room AirPlay 2
- Config flow UI — no YAML configuration needed

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.4+
- Apple TV integration configured with your HomePod(s)
- ffmpeg (included in HAOS by default)
- Google Gemini API key ([get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)) — only required if using the Gemini TTS engine or music generation
- [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) add-on (optional, enables synchronized AirPlay 2)

## Installation

### HACS (Manual Repository)

1. Open HACS → Integrations → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add this repository URL, category: **Integration**
3. Search for "HomePod TTS" and install
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/homepod_tts/` to your HA config directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **HomePod TTS**
3. Select your default HomePod (from Apple TV integration entries — if a
   HomePod and Apple TV share the same room name, they're disambiguated by
   their `media_player` entity name, e.g. "Kitchen HomePod" vs "Kitchen
   Apple TV")
4. Optionally enter your Gemini API key (only needed for the Gemini TTS
   engine or music generation — leave empty to use Edge TTS or another HA
   TTS engine)

### Options (Settings → Devices → HomePod TTS → Configure)

The options flow is two steps: first pick a **TTS engine**, then configure
the settings relevant to that engine plus the shared playback/chime/cache
settings below.

**TTS engine** — either "Gemini" or any `tts.*` engine entity configured in
Home Assistant (Edge TTS, Google Translate, Piper, etc.).

#### Gemini-only options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TTS model | gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts | Gemini model for speech synthesis |
| TTS voice | Aoede | One of 30 Gemini TTS voices |
| Style prompt | _(empty)_ | Default style instruction (e.g. "Say this calmly") |

#### HA TTS engine options (Edge TTS, Google Translate, Piper, etc.)

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Language | _(engine default)_ | Dropdown of languages/voices the selected engine supports (free text also accepted) |
| Voice | _(engine default)_ | Dropdown of voices for the selected language — only shown if the engine exposes a separate voice list |

#### Shared options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Chime | On | Play chime sound before announcement |
| Chime sound | Default chime | Bundled chime, or "Custom file path" to use Chime path below |
| Chime path | bundled soft chime | Path to custom chime MP3/WAV (used when Chime sound is "Custom file path") |
| Chime volume | 1.0 | Relative chime loudness in the mix (0.0–2.0) |

| Quiet prompt | _(whisper)_ | Style prompt used in quiet mode (Gemini only) |
| Quiet chime volume | 0.3 | Chime volume used in quiet mode |
| Quiet speakers | _(none)_ | Alternate speaker(s) used in quiet mode |

### Using a custom chime sound

Only one chime is bundled with the integration. To use a different chime
(e.g. a "ding-dong" or doorbell-style sound), set **Chime sound** to
"Custom file path" and point **Chime path** at any MP3/WAV file accessible
to Home Assistant, for example:

- A file you've placed under `/config/www/` (referenced as
  `/config/www/chimes/ding_dong.mp3`)
- One of the sound files bundled with the
  [Chime TTS](https://github.com/nimroddolev/chime_tts) integration, e.g.
  `/config/custom_components/chime_tts/sounds/dingdong.mp3` (check that
  integration's `sounds/` directory for available options)

## Usage

### Custom Service

```yaml
action: homepod_tts.say
data:
  entity_id: notify.homepod_mini_hall
  message: "Package delivered, check the front porch"
  volume_level: 0.55        # optional override
  chime: true               # optional override
  compress: moderate        # off | light | moderate | heavy
  prompt: "Say this in a gentle whisper"  # optional style
  speaker: media_player.homepod_bedroom  # optional target override
  chime_volume: 0.5         # optional, quieter chime
  offset: -1000             # optional, trim 1s from chime tail
  quiet: true               # optional, force quiet mode for this call
```

### Music Injection

Embed a `[music: prompt]` marker anywhere in your message to generate and append a Lyria 3 music clip. The marker is detected and removed from the spoken text; TTS and music are generated concurrently.

```yaml
action: homepod_tts.say
data:
  entity_id: notify.homepod_mini_hall
  message: "Hey, here's a new song for you! [music: happy upbeat children's song about monkeys in the jungle]"
```

**Position detection:**
- Marker at the **end** → chime + TTS + music
- Marker at the **start** → chime + music + TTS
- Marker in the **middle** → treated as end; surrounding text is joined

### Standalone Music Playback

```yaml
action: homepod_tts.play_music
data:
  entity_id: notify.homepod_mini_hall
  prompt: "Upbeat jazz piano, sunny afternoon mood, 30 seconds"
  volume_level: 0.6         # optional
  speaker:                  # optional target override
    - media_player.homepod_l
    - media_player.homepod_r
```

Music is generated via Gemini Lyria 3 (`lyria-3-clip-preview`) and played via Music Assistant.

### Multi-Speaker

```yaml
action: homepod_tts.say
data:
  entity_id: notify.homepod_mini_hall
  message: "Attention, important announcement!"
  speaker:
    - media_player.homepod_mini_hall
    - media_player.homepod_mini_bedroom
    - media_player.homepod_living_room
```

When Music Assistant is available, speakers are played via synchronized AirPlay 2. Otherwise pyatv streams to each speaker in parallel via `asyncio.gather` (within ~100–200 ms).

### Clear TTS Cache

```yaml
action: homepod_tts.clear_cache
```

### Notify Entity

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
target:
  entity_id: notify.homepod_mini_hall
data:
  message: "Package delivered, check the front porch"
```

## Audio Pipeline

```
Gemini TTS API → PCM (24kHz mono) ──────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                                         ├─ ffmpeg concat + resample → WAV (44.1kHz stereo)
Chime MP3 (with adelay 1s + volume adjust + offset trim/pad) ───────────┤                                   │
                                                                         │              Music Assistant or pyatv stream_file()
Lyria 3 MP3 (optional, from [music:] marker or play_music service) ─────┘                                   │
                                                                                                        HomePod
```

**Notes:**
- 1 second of silence is prepended to the first audio segment to avoid AirPlay buffering artifacts
- Compression is applied **only to TTS audio**, not the chime or music
- Gemini TTS PCM responses are cached (keyed on message + voice + model + prompt)
- ffmpeg runs every call so chime/compression/music changes never invalidate the TTS cache
- TTS and Lyria music generation run **concurrently** via `asyncio.gather` when music injection is used

## Available Gemini TTS Models

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` | Low-latency, good quality (default) |
| `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts` | Higher fidelity, slower |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` | Latest generation, 70+ languages |

For HA TTS engines (Edge TTS, Google Translate, Piper, etc.), the available
languages and voices come from that engine itself and are populated
automatically in the Language/Voice dropdowns.

## Quiet Mode & Mute

**Mute entity** (e.g. `input_boolean.do_not_disturb`): when `on`, all `say` calls are silently dropped.

**Quiet mode entity** (e.g. `binary_sensor.quiet_mode`): when `on`, the following overrides apply automatically:
- Lower volume (configurable, default 0.2)
- Whisper-style prompt
- Reduced chime volume
- Alternate speaker list (e.g. only bedroom HomePod instead of whole-home)

Mute takes precedence over quiet mode. Both can be overridden per-call via the `quiet:` field on `homepod_tts.say`.

## HomePod mini Volume Scaling

HomePod minis are quieter than full-size HomePods at the same volume level. To compensate, assign the Home Assistant label **`homepod_mini`** to the mini's `media_player` entity (either the `apple_tv` entity *or* its Music Assistant entity — the integration cross-references them by MAC, so labeling one is enough).

When a labeled speaker is targeted, the configured **HomePod mini volume scale** multiplier is applied to that speaker's volume (clamped to 0.0–1.0). For example, a scale of `1.4` plays minis 40% louder than full-size speakers at the same requested volume. A scale of `1.0` disables scaling.

> Volume scaling is applied on the **pyatv** transport (per-device volume). The Music Assistant transport applies a single `announce_volume` to all targets, so a mixed mini / full-size group played via MA shares one volume.

## Music Assistant Health Sensor

When **default speakers** are configured, the integration adds a sensor (e.g. `sensor.<name>_ma_health`) that reports whether Music Assistant can serve all of them. This makes it easy to spot when playback has silently fallen back to pyatv — for example after an HA restart before Music Assistant has reconnected.

**States:**

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | All configured default speakers resolve and are available in Music Assistant |
| `degraded` | MA is available but only some speakers are (partial synchronized playback) |
| `failed` | MA service is absent or no speakers are available → pyatv fallback is used |

**Attributes:** `transport` (`music_assistant` / `pyatv_fallback`), `available_count`, `configured_count`, `available`, `unavailable`, and `unresolved_macs` (configured MACs with no matching MA entity — useful for diagnosing discovery problems).

The sensor recomputes automatically as `media_player` entities change state.

## Entity Attributes

The notify entity exposes its effective operational configuration as state attributes for dashboards and troubleshooting, including: `tts_model`, `tts_voice`, `tts_prompt`, `volume`, `mini_volume_scale`, `effective_volume`, `chime_enabled`, `chime_volume`, `effective_chime_volume`, `compress_tts`, `default_speakers`, `effective_speakers`, `is_muted`, `is_quiet`, the quiet-mode overrides, and the cache settings. The `effective_*` values reflect quiet-mode overrides when quiet mode is active.
